ðŸ¤“ Juggling a double major in electronics and computer engineering, I'm diving deep into the world of HDLs and VLSI. My interests extend to neuromorphic processors and challenging topics like LDPC in information theory.

ðŸš€ On a mission to soak up all the knowledge! ðŸ˜„

ðŸ˜… The struggle is real, though. Remembering everything can be a challenge, so this space becomes my journal for my projects.

ðŸ¤“ Yet, oddly enough, I enjoy the challenge. Getting lost in the complexity and finding my own way through the electronic labyrinth keeps me motivated and excited about the journey.
